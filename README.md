# Enigma Unit
An interactive unit to teach the basic concepts of cryptography with a context of World War II.

### Using the Unit
There are two ways to use the unit: direct installation or through our [Hosted Version](https://enigma-unit.herokuapp.com). Currently supported by Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.

#### Direct Installation
0. Install [Node.JS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you do not have them.
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate into this repository on your machine.
3. run `npm install`
4. run `node app.js`

### About the Unit
The Enigma Unit is an interactive look into the study of cryptography, and is designed to be used by high school students. The unit involves an in-depth but digestible look at several common cryptographic algorithms including:

1. Caesar Shift
2. Vigenere Cipher
3. Enigma Machine

### Code
In addition to teaching students about using different crytographic algorithms, the unit features an (optional) look into runnable code detailing the algorithm. The code is also well-documented and abstracted in a way where it is digestable.

Algorithmic code is avaiable for all three sub-units (Caesar Shift, Vigenere Cipher, and Enigma Machine) in both encryption and decryption forms (meaning the code to encrypt a message is different from code to decrypt a message).
